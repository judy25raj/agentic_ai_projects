🧩 Agentic AI Portfolio by Judy Raj

Welcome to my professional Agentic AI portfolio — a curated collection of hands-on projects demonstrating real-world experience in Agent-based AI systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI evaluation, cloud observability, and production-grade automation.

These projects emphasize practical implementation, quality control, and operational readiness of AI systems, combining modern AI techniques with enterprise engineering practices.

Each project reflects applied knowledge in areas such as Agentic AI workflows, AI observability, evaluation frameworks, cloud deployment, and secure system design, showcasing both technical depth and architectural thinking.

📊 Featured Projects
🧠 Project 1 – Agentic AI PDF RAG with Judge Agent

Description:
Designed and implemented an Agentic AI system that performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over PDF documents and evaluates generated responses using a Judge Agent. The project demonstrates how multiple AI agents collaborate to retrieve context, generate answers, and score output quality in a structured and repeatable way.

This project focuses on AI quality assurance, response evaluation, and traceability, which are critical for enterprise AI adoption.

Key Capabilities:

Multi-agent AI workflow (Retriever, Generator, Judge)

PDF ingestion and vector-based document retrieval

Deterministic and semantic evaluation metrics

Structured JSON scoring and evaluation output

Extensible agent-based architecture

Skills Demonstrated:
Agentic AI · Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) · Python · AI Evaluation · Prompt Engineering · Structured Logging
